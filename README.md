When mouse is hovered over the module, the following keyboard shortcuts can be used

1 to 8 mute/unmute a channel

Holding G (groups) P (Presets) or C (Channels) then hitting 1 to 8, changes the Group, Preset or Channel accordingly.

Space bar starts/stops the sequencer

V toggles the View mode from Vertical, 8x8 and 1x64 

1x64 is for use with looped groups/presets.

Random - hit this then any group or preset or channel to randomise all the steps in the target
(right click menu can change the weight of the randomness)

Copy/Paste work in similar way.

Future features - built in already is a live connection with the hardware counterpart, but I've not finished the module yet :-)

Please leave any feedback in the issues above, thanks for trying this out.
